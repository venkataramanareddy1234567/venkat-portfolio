This is my final year academic project.
It is an E-Learning Platform Management System built to manage
students, tutorials, and learning progress.
</p>

<p>
The system tracks student progress and learning activity.
It also includes dashboards and reports for reviewing performance.
</p>

<p>
I created this project as part of my Computer Science and Business Systems degree.
It helped me understand how real applications manage data and user progress.
